In this project I:
    * Created links to multiple pages
    * Added images to webpages
    * Practiced atomic commits

Issues:
    * I had trouble with my first attempt to use an absolute path
    to reference an image online. I ended up pulling copies of the
    images into the project itself. However, I think the problem was
    with the link I chose. Reviewing other people's projects suggest
    that a better link would have yielded the desired results.
